Polyube metrics with Prometheus
=================================


Brief architecture
------------------





Prometheus-cpp
---------------
 The library chosen to create metrics was `Prometheus-cpp <https://github.com/jupp0r/prometheus-cpp.git>`_ which was added as a submodule to Polycube, modifying the gitsubmodules file and the CMakeLists.txt in polycube/src/polycubed/src (a comment for the future has also been added in the file scripts/pre-requirements.sh)
